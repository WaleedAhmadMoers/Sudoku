# Sudoku
Code to generate a Sudoku board by slicing and shuffling arrays. Demonstrates array manipulation with 'modifySlicedArrayElementsPosition' and 'shuffleAndPrintArray' functions. Prints a Sudoku board with 3 rows, each containing shuffled slices from the original array. Provides an example of array operations


The algorithm generates a Sudoku board that adheres to the rules of the game, ensuring that numbers don't repeat within rows, columns, or 3x3 boxes. The magic lies in how the numbers are shuffled and positioned.

The initial originalArray contains numbers 1 to 9.

The array is divided into three slices: firstSlice, secondSlice, and thirdSlice, representing the three sections of the Sudoku board.

The modifySlicedArrayElementsPosition function swaps the positions of elements within each slice. It performs a cyclic shift of the elements, ensuring that no numbers repeat within each slice.

The shuffleAndPrintArray function shuffles an array by swapping elements. It ensures that within each slice, the numbers are rearranged in a way that they don't repeat in rows or columns.

The getSudokuBoard function generates the Sudoku board. It iterates three times to create three rows of the board.

Within each iteration, the positions of elements in the slices are modified using modifySlicedArrayElementsPosition. This ensures that the numbers within each slice don't repeat in rows or columns.

The modified slices are stored in the modifiedArray.

The shuffleAndPrintArray function is called three times to shuffle and print the modified arrays. This guarantees that the numbers within each row of the Sudoku board don't repeat in columns or rows.
